### Moody Programs for the Rainy Days

Like many exercises in self-expression, this project began with the bleak and salty aftermath of a truly disastrous job interview. Forthcoming additions will be equally bleak, a celebration of dark humor and wet parades. 

These dungeon crawls are part whimsy, part satire, mostly depressing, but with a smattering of hope thrown in for good measure...but only a little bit.

My language of choice is Python 3, but I may experiment with other languages as I learn their nuances.

### Pair Programming: Misery Loves Company

The first program is a brief exchange between myself and a good friend and mentor named John. An artist himself, you can find John's work at https://github.com/JohnEarnest

The first file has a bug towards the end: inputing the desired response causes the program to misunderstand the input and ask for the desired response, effectively trapping you in an ongoing loop of futility. I almost like it better this way; it is satire, after all.

However, in the interest of correctness, I'll fix the bug and let the player continue -- or, if I decide to leave it, I'll do so deliberately, with a detailed understanding of what went wrong.
